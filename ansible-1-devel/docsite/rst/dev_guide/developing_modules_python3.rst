Ansible and Porting to Python 3
===============================

Ansible can be divided into three overlapping pieces for the purposes of
porting:

1. Controller-side code.  This is the code which runs on the machine where you
   invoke /usr/bin/ansible
2. Modules.  This is the code which Ansible transmits over the wire and
   invokes on the managed machine.
3. module_utils code.  This is code whose primary purpose is to be used by the
   modules to perform tasks.  However, some controller-side code might use
   generic functions from here.

Much of the knowledge of porting code will be usable on all three of these
pieces but there are some special considerations for some of it as well.

--------------------------------------------
Minimum Version of Python-3.x and Python-2.x
--------------------------------------------

In controller side code, we support Python-3.5 or greater and Python-2.6 or
greater.

For modules (and by extension, module_utils) we support
Python-3.5 and Python-2.4. Python-3.5 was chosen as a minimum because it is the earliest Python-3 version
adopted as the default Python by a Long Term Support (LTS) Linux distribution (in this case, Ubuntu-16.04).  
Previous LTS Linux distributions shipped with a Python-2 version which users can rely upon instead of the 
Python-3 version.

For Python-2, the default is for modules to run on Python-2.4.  This allows
users with older distributions that are stuck on Python-2.4 to manage their
machines.  Modules are allowed to drop support for Python-2.4 when one of
their dependent libraries requires a higher version of Python.  This is not an
invitation to add unnecessary dependent libraries in order to force your
module to be usable only with a newer version of Python.; instead it is an
acknowledgment that some libraries (for instance, boto3 and docker-py) will
only function with a newer version of Python.

.. note:: Python-2.4 Support:

    The only long term supported distro that we know of with Python-2.4 support is
    RHEL5 (and its rebuilds like CentOS5), which is supported until April of
    2017.  For Ansible, that means Ansible-2.3 will be the last major release
    that supports Python-2.4 for modules.  Ansible-2.4 will require
    Python-2.6 or greater for modules.

-----------------------------------
Porting Controller Code to Python 3
-----------------------------------

Most of the general tips for porting code to be used on both Python-2 and
Python-3 applies to porting controller code.  The best place to start learning
to port code is `Lennart Regebro's book: Porting to Python 3 <http://python3porting.com/>`_.

The book describes several strategies for porting to Python 3.  The one we're
using is `to support Python-2 and Python-3 from a single code base
<http://python3porting.com/strategies.html#python-2-and-python-3-without-conversion>`_

Controller String Strategy
==========================

Background
----------

One of the most essential things to decide upon for porting code to Python-3
is what string model to use.  Strings can be an array of bytes (like in C) or
they can be an array of text.  Text is what we think of as letters, digits,
numbers, other printable symbols, and a small number of unprintable "symbols"
(control codes).

In Python-2, the two types for these (:class:`str` for bytes and
:class:`unicode` for text) are often used interchangably.  When dealing only
with ASCII characters, the strings can be combined, compared, and converted
from one type to another automatically.  When non-ASCII characters are
introduced, Python starts throwing exceptions due to not knowing what encoding
the non-ASCII characters should be in.

Python-3 changes this behavior by making the separation between bytes (:class:`bytes`)
and text (:class:`str`) more strict.  Python will throw an exception when
trying to combine and compare the two types.  The programmer has to explicitly
convert from one type to the other to mix values from each.

This change makes it immediately apparent to the programmer when code is
mixing the types inappropriately, rather than working until one of their users
causes an exception by entering non-ASCII input.  However, it forces the
programmer to proactively define a strategy for working with strings in their
program so that they don't mix text and byte strings unintentionally.

Unicode Sandwich
----------------

In controller-side code we use a strategy known as the Unicode Sandwich (named
after Python-2's :class:`unicode` text type).  For Unicode Sandwich we know that
at the border of our code and the outside world (for example, file and network IO,
environment variables, and some library calls) we are going to receive bytes.
We need to transform these bytes into text and use that throughout the
internal portions of our code.  When we have to send those strings back out to
the outside world we first convert the text back into bytes.
To visualize this, imagine a 'sandwich' consisting of a top and bottom layer
of bytes, a layer of conversion between, and all text type in the center.

Common Borders
--------------

This is a partial list of places where we have to convert to and from bytes.
It's not exhaustive but gives you an idea of where to watch for problems.

Reading and writing to files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Python-2, reading from files yields bytes.  In Python-3, it can yield text.
To make code that's portable to both we don't make use of Python-3's ability
to yield text but instead do the conversion explicitly ourselves. For example::

    from ansible.module_utils._text import to_text

    with open('filename-with-utf8-data.txt', 'rb') as my_file:
        b_data = my_file.read()
        try:
            data = to_text(b_data, errors='surrogate_or_strict')
        except UnicodeError:
            # Handle the exception gracefully -- usually by displaying a good
            # user-centric error message that can be traced back to this piece
            # of code.

.. note:: Much of Ansible assumes that all encoded text is UTF-8.  At some
    point, if there is demand for other encodings we may change that, but for
    now it is safe to assume that bytes are UTF-8.

Writing to files is the opposite process::

    from ansible.module_utils._text import to_bytes

    with open('filename.txt', 'wb') as my_file:
        my_file.write(to_bytes(some_text_string))

Note that we don't have to catch :exc:`UnicodeError` here because we're
transforming to UTF-8 and all text strings in Python can be transformed back
to UTF-8.

Filesystem Interaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dealing with filenames often involves dropping back to bytes because on UNIX-like
systems filenames are bytes.  On Python-2, if we pass a text string to these
functions, the text string will be converted to a byte string inside of the
function and a traceback will occur if non-ASCII characters are present.  In
Python-3, a traceback will only occur if the text string can't be decoded in
the current locale, but it's still good to be explicit and have code which
works on both versions::

    import os.path

    from ansible.module_utils._text import to_bytes

    filename = u'/var/tmp/くらとみ.txt'
    f = open(to_bytes(filename), 'wb')
    mtime = os.path.getmtime(to_bytes(filename))
    b_filename = os.path.expandvars(to_bytes(filename))
    if os.path.exists(to_bytes(filename)):
        pass

When you are only manipulating a filename as a string without talking to the
filesystem (or a C library which talks to the filesystem) you can often get
away without converting to bytes::

    import os.path

    os.path.join(u'/var/tmp/café', u'くらとみ')
    os.path.split(u'/var/tmp/café/くらとみ')

On the other hand, if the code needs to manipulate the filename and also talk
to the filesystem, it can be more convenient to transform to bytes right away
and manipulate in bytes.

.. warning:: Make sure all variables passed to a function are the same type.
    If you're working with something like :func:`os.path.join` which takes
    multiple strings and uses them in combination, you need to make sure that
    all the types are the same (either all bytes or all text).  Mixing
    bytes and text will cause tracebacks.

Interacting with Other Programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Interacting with other programs goes through the operating system and
C libraries and operates on things that the UNIX kernel defines.  These
interfaces are all byte-oriented so the Python interface is byte oriented as
well.  On both Python-2 and Python-3, byte strings should be given to Python's
subprocess library and byte strings should be expected back from it.

One of the main places in Ansible's controller code that we interact with
other programs is the connection plugins' ``exec_command`` methods.  These
methods transform any text strings they receive in the command (and arugments
to the command) to execute into bytes and return stdout and stderr as byte strings 
Higher level functions (like action plugins' ``_low_level_execute_command``)
transform the output into text strings.

Tips, tricks, and idioms to adopt
=================================

Forwards Compatibility Boilerplate
----------------------------------

Use the following boilerplate code at the top of all controller-side modules
to make certain constructs act the same way on Python-2 and Python-3::

    # Make coding more python3-ish
    from __future__ import (absolute_import, division, print_function)
    __metaclass__ = type

``__metaclass__ = type`` makes all classes defined in the file into new-style
classes without explicitly inheriting from :class:`object`.

The ``__future__`` imports do the following:

:absolute_import: Makes imports look in :attr:`sys.path` for the modules being
    imported, skipping the directory in which the module doing the importing
    lives.  If the code wants to use the directory in which the module doing
    the importing, there's a new dot notation to do so.
:division: Makes division of integers always return a float.  If you need to
   find the quotient use ``x // y`` instead of ``x / y``.
:print_function: Changes :func:`print` from a keyword into a function.

.. seealso::
    * `PEP 0328: Absolute Imports <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328/#guido-s-decision>`_
    * `PEP 0238: Division <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238>`_
    * `PEP 3105: Print function <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3105>`_

Prefix byte strings with "b\_"
------------------------------

Since mixing text and bytes types leads to tracebacks we want to be clear
about what variables hold text and what variables hold bytes.  We do this by
prefixing any variable holding bytes with ``b_``.  For instance::

    filename = u'/var/tmp/café.txt'
    b_filename = to_bytes(filename)
    with open(b_filename) as f:
        data = f.read()

We do not prefix the text strings instead because we only operate
on byte strings at the borders, so there are fewer variables that need bytes
than text.

---------------------------
Porting Modules to Python 3
---------------------------

Ansible modules are not the usual Python-3 porting exercise.  There are two
factors that make it harder to port them than most code:

1. Many modules need to run on Python-2.4 in addition to Python-3.
2. A lot of mocking has to go into unit testing a Python-3 module, so it's
   harder to test that your porting has fixed everything or to to make sure that
   later commits haven't regressed.

Module String Strategy
======================

There are a large number of modules in Ansible.  Most of those are maintained
by the Ansible community at large, not by a centralized team.  To make life
easier on them, it was decided not to break backwards compatibility by
mandating that all strings inside of modules are text and converting between
text and bytes at the borders; instead, we're using a native string strategy
for now.

Tips, tricks, and idioms to adopt
=================================

Exceptions
----------

In code which already needs Python-2.6+ (for instance, because a library it
depends on only runs on Python >= 2.6) it is okay to port directly to the new
exception-catching syntax::

    try:
        a = 2/0
    except ValueError as e:
        module.fail_json(msg="Tried to divide by zero!")

For modules which also run on Python-2.4, we have to use an uglier
construction to make this work under both Python-2.4 and Python-3::

    from ansible.module_utils.pycompat24 import get_exception
    [...]

    try:
        a = 2/0
    except ValueError:
        e = get_exception()
        module.fail_json(msg="Tried to divide by zero!")

Octal numbers
-------------

In Python-2.4, octal literals are specified as ``0755``.  In Python-3, that is
invalid and octals must be specified as ``0o755``.  To bridge this gap,
modules should create their octals like this::

    # Can't use 0755 on Python-3 and can't use 0o755 on Python-2.4
    EXECUTABLE_PERMS = int('0755', 8)

Bundled six
-----------

The third-party python-six library exists to help projects create code that
runs on both Python-2 and Python-3.  Ansible includes version 1.4.1 in
module_utils so that other modules can use it without requiring that it is
installed on the remote system.  To make use of it, import it like this::

    from ansible.module_utils import six

.. note:: Why version 1.4.1?

    six-1.4.1 is the last version of python-six to support Python-2.4.  As
    long as Ansible modules need to run on Python-2.4 we won't be able to
    update the bundled copy of six.

Compile Test
------------

We have travis compiling all modules with various versions of Python to check
that the modules conform to the syntax at those versions.  When you've
ported a module so that its syntax works with Python-3, we need to modify
.travis.yml so that the module is included in the syntax check.  Here's the
relevant section of .travis.yml::

    env:
      global:
        - PY3_EXCLUDE_LIST="cloud/amazon/cloudformation.py
          cloud/amazon/ec2_ami.py
          [...]
          utilities/logic/wait_for.py"

The :envvar:`PY3_EXCLUDE_LIST` environment variable is a blacklist of modules
which should not be tested (because we know that they are older modules which
have not yet been ported to pass the Python-3 syntax checks.  To get another
old module to compile with Python-3, remove the entry for it from the list.
The goal is to have the LIST be empty.

-------------------------------------
Porting module_utils code to Python 3
-------------------------------------

module_utils code is largely like module code.  However, some pieces of it are
used by the controller as well.  Because of this, it needs to be usable with
the controller's assumptions.  This is most notable in the string strategy.

Module_utils String Strategy
============================

Module_utils **must** use the Native String Strategy.  Functions in
module_utils receive either text strings or byte strings and may emit either
the same type as they were given or the native string for the Python version
they are run on depending on which makes the most sense for that function.
Functions which return strings **must** document whether they return text,
byte, or native strings. Module-utils functions are therefore often very
defensive in nature, converting from potential text or bytes at the
beginning of a function and converting to the native string type at the end.
