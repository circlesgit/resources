<div>Fail build if generated item(s) have the same name as existing items already managed by another seed job. By default, this plugin will always regenerate all jobs and views, thus updating previously generated jobs and views even if managed by another seed job. Check this box if you wish to fail the job if a generated item name collision is detected.</div>
