user=>catalog=>product

For istio chapter we are going to use a simple commerical application which consist of 3 microservices.
1. user: this microservice is for user validation, it calls microservices catalog if user authenticates
2. catalog: this microservice calls product microservice to get list of products available for this user, this microservice 
has 3 versions.
3. product: this microservice gives list of products available for particular user.

Dockerfile has been provided for each microservice in its directory, use it to create images. After creating images go to 
istio_lab directory and 
run command 'kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f app.yaml)' it will creates pods with sidecars which will be used in 
exercises of Istio chapter.
