# JIRA integration pack

This pack consists of a sample JIRA sensor and a JIRA action.

## Configuration

Copy the example configuration in [jira.yaml.example](./jira.yaml.example)
to `/opt/stackstorm/configs/jira.yaml` and edit as required.

* ``url`` - URL of the JIRA instance (e.g. ``https://myproject.atlassian.net``)
* ``rsa_cert_file`` - Path to the file with a private key.
* ``oauth_token`` - OAuth token.
* ``oauth_secret`` - OAuth secret.
* ``consumer_key`` - Consumer key.
* ``poll_interval`` - Polling interval - default 30s
* ``project`` - Key of the project which will be used as a default with some of the actions which
  don't require or allow you to specify a project (e.g. ``STORM``).

To get these OAuth credentials, take a look at OAuth section bellow.

You can also use dynamic values from the datastore. See the
[docs](https://docs.stackstorm.com/reference/pack_configs.html) for more info.

### OAuth

### Disclaimer

This documentation is written as of 06/17/2014. JIRA 6.3 implements OAuth1. Most of this doc would need to be revised when JIRA switches to OAuth2.

### Steps

1. Generate RSA public/private key pair
    ```
    # This will create a 2048 length RSA private key
    $openssl genrsa -out mykey.pem 2048
    ```

    ```
    # Now, create the public key associated with that private key
    openssl rsa -in mykey.pem -pubout
    ```
2. Generate a consumer key. You can use python uuid.uuid4() to do this.
3. Configure JIRA for external access:
     * Go to AppLinks section of your JIRA - https://JIRA_SERVER/plugins/servlet/applinks/listApplicationLinks
     * Create a Generic Application with some fake URL
     * Click Edit, hit IncomingAuthentication. Plug in the consumer key and RSA public key you generated.
4. Get access token using this [script](https://github.com/lakshmi-kannan/jira-oauth-access-token-generator/blob/master/generate_access_token.py). These are the ones that are printed at the last. Save these keys somewhere safe. 
5. Plug in the access token and access secret into the sensor or action. You are good to make JIRA calls. Note: OAuth token expires. You'll have to repeat the process based on the expiry date. 

## Sensors

### JiraSensor

The sensor monitors for new tickets and sends a trigger into the system whenever there is a new ticket.

## Actions

* ``create_issue`` - Action which creates a new JIRA issue.
* ``get_issue`` - Action which retrieves details for a particular issue.
