## DEPRECATION NOTICE

OpenStack pack is now at https://github.com/StackStorm/openstack 
and is using a different approach to integrating with OpenStack. 

For now, the OpenStack pack only has actions which basically use
the OpenStack CLI bindings. For more advanced integrations,
you may want to use openstack APIs directly.
