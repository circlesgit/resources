# Yammer Integration Pack

This integration pack allows you to integrate with
[Yammer](http://yammer.com/),
the Enterprise Social Network.

## Actions

Currently, the following actions listed bellow are supported:

* `authenticate` - Get an authentication URL for the application, use this in a browser to gain a code. Put this code in config.yaml
* `delete_group` - Removing a group
* `delete_message` - Remove a message
* `email_message` - Send the contents of a message to yourself
* `get_group_by_id` - Fetch the group details by ID
* `get_user_by_email` - Fetch a user by email
* `get_user_by_id` - Fetch a user by id
* `list_groups` - Get all groups
* `list_messages` - List all messages
* `list_messages_in_group` - List all messages in a group
* `list_messages_about_topic` - List all messages about a particular topic
* `list_messages_from_user` - List all messages from a particular user
* `list_messages_my_feed` - List messages for my feed
* `list_private_messages` - List the messages in your inbox
* `list_users`
* `list_users_in_group`
* `like_message` - Like a particular message
* `post_message` - Post a message to a user, a group or a topic
* `suspend_user` - Suspend a user (admins only)

## Configuration

Update config.yaml to setup the connection to Yammer.

* `client_id` - The client ID provided by Yammer for your app
* `client_secret` - The client secret provided by Yammer for your app
* `expected_redirect` - The redirect Yammer expects to send you to, configured below.
* `access_code` - The code generated by viewing the URL provided when running `authenticate`

in Yammer you need to setup a client application on (https://www.yammer.com/client_applications) and use the details provided for your configuration.

Once you configure those details in config.yaml, run the `authenticate` action, which will give you a URL. Navigate to that URL in a browser and login to Yammer.
This will give you a code, which you can use in config.yaml to enable the rest of the integration.
