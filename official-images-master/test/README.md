# Official Images Test Suite

## Running Tests

```console
$ ./run.sh

usage: run.sh [-t test ...] image:tag [...]
   ie: run.sh debian:wheezy
       run.sh -t utc python:3
       run.sh -t utc python:3 -t python-hy

This script processes the specified Docker images to test their running
environments.
```

Run all the tests that are applicable to the `debian:wheezy` image:

```console
$ ./run.sh debian:wheezy
testing debian:wheezy
	'utc' [1/2]...passed
	'cve-2014--shellshock' [2/2]...passed
```

Try to run just the `python-hy` test against the `debian:wheezy` image: (which doesn't contain Python)

```console
$ ./run.sh -t python-hy debian:wheezy
testing debian:wheezy
```

Run the `utc` test against both the `python:3` and `python:2` images:

```console
$ ./run.sh -t utc python:3 python:2
testing python:3
	'utc' [1/1]...passed
testing python:2
	'utc' [1/1]...passed
```

Run the `utc` and `python-hy` tests against `python:3`, `python:2`, and `debian:wheezy`:

```console
$ ./run.sh -t utc -t python-hy python:3 python:2 debian:wheezy
testing python:3
	'utc' [1/2]...passed
	'python-hy' [2/2]...passed
testing python:2
	'utc' [1/2]...passed
	'python-hy' [2/2]...passed
testing debian:wheezy
	'utc' [1/1]...passed
```

Run the `python-hy` test against `python:3` and `pypy:3`:

```console
$ ./run.sh -t python-hy python:3 pypy:3
testing python:3
	'python-hy' [1/1]...passed
testing pypy:3
	'python-hy' [1/1]...passed
```

## Writing Tests

### `tests/<test name>/`

Each test lives in a separate directory inside `tests/`, and `config.sh` determines which images each test applies to.

#### `tests/<test name>/run.sh`

This is the actual "test script". In the script, `$1` is the name of the image we're testing. An exit code of zero indicates success/passing, and a non-zero exit code indicates failure.

For example, `tests/utc/run.sh` consists of:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

docker run --rm --entrypoint date "$1" +%Z
```

Which runs `date` inside the given image, and outputs the current timezone according to `date +%Z`, which should be `UTC`. See `tests/<test name>/expected-std-out.txt` below for the other half of this test.

There are several pre-written `run.sh` scripts to help with common tasks. See the `tests/run-*-in-container.sh` section below for more details about these.

#### `tests/<test name>/expected-std-out.txt`

If this file exists, then this test's `run.sh` is expected to output exactly the contents of this file on standard output, and differences will be assumed to denote test failure.

To continue with our `utc` test example, its contents in this file are simply:

	UTC

If a test fails due to having incorrect output, the `diff` between the generated output and the expected output will be displayed:

```console
$ ./run.sh -t utc fedora:21
testing fedora:21
	'utc' [1/1]...failed; unexpected output:
--- tests/utc/expected-std-out.txt	2015-02-05 16:52:05.013273118 -0700
+++ -	2015-03-13 15:11:49.725116569 -0600
@@ -1 +1 @@
-UTC
+EDT
```

(this is an example of `fedora:21` failing the `utc` test)

#### `tests/run-*-in-container.sh`

These scripts are intended to be used as symlink targets for test `run.sh` scripts.

For example, if `tests/python-sometest/run.sh` is a symlink to `../run-python-in-container.sh`, then `tests/run-python-in-container.sh` will execute `python tests/python-sometest/container.py` inside the image.

To illustrate further:

```console
$ ls -l tests/hylang-sh/
total 8
-rw-rw-r-- 1 tianon tianon 167 Mar 11 13:24 container.hy
-rw-rw-r-- 1 tianon tianon   5 Mar 11 13:24 expected-std-out.txt
lrwxrwxrwx 1 tianon tianon  25 Mar 11 13:25 run.sh -> ../run-hy-in-container.sh
$ ls -l tests/python-hy/
total 4
lrwxrwxrwx 1 tianon tianon 25 Mar 11 13:25 container.hy -> ../hylang-sh/container.hy
-rw-rw-r-- 1 tianon tianon 56 Mar 11 13:24 container.sh
lrwxrwxrwx 1 tianon tianon 33 Mar 11 13:25 expected-std-out.txt -> ../hylang-sh/expected-std-out.txt
lrwxrwxrwx 1 tianon tianon 27 Feb  5 16:52 run.sh -> ../run-bash-in-container.sh
$ cat tests/python-hy/container.sh
#!/bin/bash
set -e

pip install -q hy
hy ./container.hy
```

## Configuring the Test Suite

### `config.sh`

This file controls which tests apply (or don't apply) to each image.

When testing an image, the list of tests to apply are calculated by doing `globalTests + imageTests[testAlias[image]] + imageTests[image]`. Any tests for which `globalExcludeTests[image_test]` is set are removed. If `-t` is specified one or more times, any tests not specified explicitly via `-t` are also removed.

#### `globalTests=( test ... )`

This list of tests applies to every image minus combinations listed in `globalExcludeTests` (such as `hello-world` not getting the `utc` test, since it has no `date` binary in order for the test to work).

```bash
globalTests+=(
	utc
	cve-2014--shellshock
)
```

#### `testAlias=( [image]='image' ... )`

This array defines image aliases -- for example, the `pypy` image should inherit all the standard `python` image tests, since it's a functionally equivalent implementation of Python. As noted in `globalTests`, any image+test combinations that shouldn't or can't be tested as a result of this aliasing can be excluded via `globalExcludeTests`.

```bash
testAlias+=(
	[pypy]='python'
	[jruby]='ruby'

	[mariadb]='mysql'
	[percona]='mysql'
)
```

#### `imageTests=( [image]='test ...' ... )`

This array defines the list of explicit tests for each image. For example, the `mysql` image (and aliased derivatives via `testAlias`) has a test which verifies that basic functionality works, such as starting up the image and connecting to it from a separate container.

```bash
imageTests+=(
	[python]='
		python-hy
		python-pip-requests-ssl
	'
	[mysql]='
		mysql-basics
	'
)
```

#### `globalExcludeTests=( [image_test]=1 ... )`

Defines image+test combinations which shouldn't ever run (usually because they won't work, like trying to run `date` in the `hello-world` image for the `utc` test, which has only one binary).

```bash
globalExcludeTests+=(
	# single-binary images
	[hello-world_utc]=1
	[swarm_utc]=1
)
```

### Alternate config files

If you would like to run the Official Image tests against your own images, you can use the `-c/--config` flag to specify one or more alternate config files. These config files should configure the same environment variables used by the default `config.sh` (see above).

```bash
imageTests+=(
	[myorg/myimage]='
		my-custom-test
	'
)
```

**Note**: If you do use your own config file, the `config.sh` included here will no longer be loaded by default. If you want to load it in addition to your own config file (for example, to run the `globalTests` against your own image), use an additional `--config` flag.

```console
$ /path/to/official-images/test/run.sh --config /path/to/official-images/test/config.sh --config ./my-config.sh myimage
```
