# to get a one-liner "grep" to take a list and pare it down to just heavy hitters, use something like:
#   echo "grep -E '^($(grep -vE '^$|^#' heavy-hitters.txt | paste -sd '|'))(:|\$)'"
# output will be something like:
#   grep -E '^(foo|bar|baz|...)(:|$)'
# (swap "-E" to "-vE" to exclude instead of include)
